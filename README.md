znc-buildpak
=============

This works as of 2/8/2021

Host a ZNC Bouncer on Heroku using ngrok

Include your znc.conf in your app project and point it to use this build pack.

Also include a ngrok.conf. I personally used ngrok.yml instead of .conf because Heroku was having some issues.

See the sample project at https://github.com/j-mcnally/heroku-znc-example for deets.
